#How to compile the payload
In order to get a binary dump of the payload you'll need to run the `make`.

#Final Steps
Inject manually the payload into the savegame, patch it with the CRCFix and enjoy!

#Requeriments
DevKitPro ARM

#Important Note
In the assembly to binary compilation, the -Ttext=0x00000000 argument is important.
In ARM, branches (jumps) are relative so for the payload to access memory relative to it you
must set this value to where your payload will start in memory.
